title: "Are Expired Masks Safe?"
---

Many face masks expire a few years after they are manufactured. While new masks are safest, an expired mask is almost always safer than no mask at all.

Unless otherwise noted on the packaging, all masks distributed by Mask Bloc San José are unexpired at the time of distribution.

The amazing team at [Mask Bloc East Bay](https://www.instagram.com/maskbloceastbay/) put together [a document that summarizes research](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mSB7Bk83XAJqAeQph2K4BlPkhfVOoqKrH7FXUAlAB98/) into the safety of expired masks. We encourage community members to look at this and other resources, to make an informed decision about whether they are comfortable using expired masks.
